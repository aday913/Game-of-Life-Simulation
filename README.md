### Project Goal:
To simulate the board game "The Game of Life" in order to determine whether the winner of game is generally determined by random chance

**Major Steps**:
- [ ] Create a game object that loads the spaces of the board (whose actions may be stored in another file), the cards, tiles, etc.
- [ ] Create a player object that holds all relevant attributes that a player would have in a real game
- [ ] Allow for player actions to be determined using different methods, for example one being completely random and one being based on heuristic values
- [ ] Analyze the results of many games using various data analytics tools
